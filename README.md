## Book recommendation system
This project involves building a book recommendation system using PySpark, using the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) collaborative filtering algorithm.

**Key design elements:**

1. Preparing data for the Recommendation System (ALS â€“ item/user/rating):

   - Pre-process the dataset to make it suitable for collaborative filtering, including relevant item/user/rating information.

2. Creating a collective filtration model (for given hyperparameter values) and determining forecast errors.

3. Refine the model through cross-validation:

     - Apply cross-validation techniques using tools such as CrossValidator and ParamGridBuilder in PySpark.
     - Experiment with different combinations of hyperparameters to obtain a more efficient model compared to the model developed in step 2.
